<h2>Overview</h2> 

A room dedicated to support a <kc>Standing Buffet Service</kc> is equipped  with a set of (smart and non-smart) resources including
a <em>fridge</em>, a <em>dishwasher</em>, a <em>pantry</em>, and a ddr robot able to work as a <em>Room Butler</em> (called from
now on <bc>RBR</bc> (<tt>Room Butter Robot</tt>).

<br/><br/>
The <em>fridge</em>, the <em>dishwasher</em> and the <em>pantry</em> are embedded into a wall of the room, 
so to exclude any protuberance from the wall itself. 
<br/><br/>
A <em>Table</em> is put at the center of the room, so that a possible room configuration
looks like that shown in the following picture:

	<center><table style="width:98%">
	<tbody>	
	<tr>
	<td style="width:60%">
	<h3>Standing Buffet Service room </h3>
	<center><img src="./roomLayout.png" alt="roomLayout" width="75%" height="32%"/></center>
	</td> 
	<td><m>
	<li><em>RH</em> : home location of the <bc>RBR</bc></li>
 	<li><em>fridge</em> a 'Internet Thing'</li>
	<br/><br/>
	For a possible virtual environment, see <a href="../sceneConfig.js" target="lecture">sceneConfig.js</a>
   	</m>
 	</td>
	 </table>
	</center> 	
The behavior of the <tt>Buffet Service</tt> is supervised by a <em>Ma√Ætre de salle</em> (or simply <bc>Maitre</bc>) 
which can tell the <bc>RBR</bc> to perform a set of  tasks, including:

<ol>
<li><i>Prepare the room</i>. This task consists in putting on the <em>Table</em> dishes taken from the 
<em>pantry</em>, and food taken from the <em>fridge</em>. The set of items to put on the table 
in this phase is fixed and properly described somewhere.</li>

<li><i>Clear the room</i>. This task consists in bringing non-consumed food  again  in the <em>fridge</em> and 
the dishes in the <em>dishwasher</em>.</li>
<li><i>Add food</i> on the table. This task consists in bringing some specific food (if it exists)
from the <em>fridge</em> to the <em>Table</em>.
</ol>

Thus, the <em>fridge</em> is intended to be a smart device owning explicit knowledge of the food stored in it.
Moreover, it should be able to answer (via <ks>CoAP</ks>) to questions about its content, asked by humans or machines.

<br/><br/>
The <em>pantry</em>  and the <em>dishwasher</em> are (at the moment) non-smart resources.
<h2>Requirements</h2> 	

<div class="req">
Design and build the software to put on board of the <em>fridge</em> and of the <bc>RBR</bc>. In particular,
the <bc>RBR</bc> must be able to accept the following commands sent by the <ks>smart-phone</ks> of <bc>Maitre</bc>:

<ul>
<li><em>prepare</em>: the <bc>RBR</bc> must execute in autonomous way the <i>Prepare the room</i> task.</li>
<li><em>add food</em>:   the <bc>RBR</bc> must execute in autonomous way  the <i>Add food</i> task.</li>
<li><em>clear</em>:  the <bc>RBR</bc> must execute in autonomous way the <i>Clear the room</i> task.</li>
</ul>

These tasks are normally executed in sequence, and the main scenario can be summarized as follows:

<ol>
<li>At start, the room is empty (i.e. no people is in it, besides the <bc>Maitre</bc>) while the <em>pantry</em>
and the <em>fridge</em> are filled with a proper set of items. The <bc>RBR</bc> is in its <ks>RH</ks> location
and the <em>dishwasher</em> is empty.</li>
<li>The <bc>Maitre</bc> sends to the <bc>RBR</bc> the <em>prepare</em> command and waits for the completion
of the related task. At the end, the <bc>RBR</bc> is in its <ks>RH</ks> location again. </li>
<li>The <bc>Maitre</bc> opens the room to people. During the service, the <bc>Maitre</bc> can send to the <bc>RBR</bc>
the <em>add food</em> command, by specifying a <em>food-code</em>. The <bc>RBR</bc> executes the task only if food
with the given code is available in the <em>fridge</em>, otherwise it sends a warning to the <bc>Maitre</bc>. After the task completion,
the <bc>RBR</bc> returns is in its <ks>RH</ks> location.
</li>
<li>At the end of the party, the <bc>Maitre</bc> <bc>Maitre</bc> sends to the <bc>RBR</bc> the <em>clear</em> command
and waits for the completion of the task. The <bc>RBR</bc> returns is in its <ks>RH</ks> location again.
</ol>



However, the <bc>Maitre</bc> is able, at any time, to
use his/her smart-phone to:
<ul>
<li><em>consult</em> the <kc>state of the room</kc>, e.g. to known what are the objects related to each resource;
for example, the object currently posed on the <em>Table</em>, in the <em>dishwasher</em>, etc;</li>
<li><em>stop</em> or <em>reactivate</em> an activated task.</li>
</ul>
 
Finally, the <bc>RBR</bc> must be able to 
<ul>
<li><em>avoid </em>the impact with mobile obstacles (e.g. the <bc>Maitre</bc> 
or other humans / animals present in the room).</li>
</ul>

The software to put on the <em>fridge</em> should make the device able to:
<ul>
<li><em>expose</em> its current content on the <bc>Maitre</bc> smart-phone;</li>
<li><em>answer</em> to questions about its content (e.g. if it contains food with a given code ).</li>
</ul>


</div>	    

<h2>Non functional requirements</h2>  
<ol>
<li>The ideal work team is composed of 3 persons. Teams of 1 or 2 persons (NOT 4 or more) are also allowed. </li>
<li>The team must present a workplan as the result of the requirement/problem analysis,
including at least one TestPlan.</li>
<li>The team must present the sequence of SPRINT performed, with appropriate motivations.</li>
<li>The team must present (in synthetic, schematic way) the specific activity of each team-component.</li>
</ol>
