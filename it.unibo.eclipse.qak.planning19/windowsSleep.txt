Instructions

1. search device manager and open it
2. expand display driver
3. right click on it.
4. uninstall
5. you will be prompted "warning: you are about to uninstall this device from this system" 
6. MAKE SURE NOT TO "delete driver software from this device" By leaving the check box blank.
7. click uninstall (don't worry)
8. if not prompted already, do a "RESTART" immediately. (do not do a "shut down" and then power back on. Click on "restart.")
9. upon rebooting windows reinstalls the driver automatically
10. after first reboot you will likely need to do another restart after windows has reinstalled the driver.

Once this was done my problem was solved. the display driver thing sounds silly but it sounds 
like integrated graphics problem which could have something to do with the way windows manages 
the memory of the integrated GPU and CPU causing some sort of Driver conflict. 
Almost sounds like it's something Intel needs to do some work on.
 I am curious if anyone is having these issues with dedicated graphics or an AMD CPU.
